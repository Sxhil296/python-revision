"""
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.

Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation.

The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer,
the most common use is four, but it has to be at least one.

1 tab = 4 spaces
